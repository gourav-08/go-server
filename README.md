My First Golang project.
This projects aims to create a golang web server using the in-built net/http package.

The web server has 3 routes,
1. The index route - which displays a message 'Static website'.
2. The "/hello" route - which returns back a message 'Hello!'.
3. The "/form.html" route - which takes input from the form and returns the same data.
